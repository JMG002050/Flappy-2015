# 🎮 Flappy 2015 - A Mini JavaScript Arcade Game

Welcome to **Flappy 2015**, a simple yet fun keyboard-based mini game built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Inspired by the classic Flappy Bird feel — but with my own twist — this game challenges you to bounce the ball and dodge moving pipes from above and below.

> 💡 Hold any key to rise. Release to drop. Avoid the pipes. Survive as long as you can!
